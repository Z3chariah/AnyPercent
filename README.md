## This is a sttudy tool that leverages Active Recall principles.

A pixel art styled website inspired by my love for world-building as well as my need to study very dense procedural content quickly.
A primary use case is to create flashcards, parcipate in focus sessions, experience a more gamified way of studying

My goal in creating this tool is to create a minimalistic and light-weight alternative to other productivity focused tools.

You may clone the localhost and all dependencies via:

'''bash
$ npm i && example docker
'''
